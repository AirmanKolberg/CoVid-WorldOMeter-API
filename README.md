# CoVid Case/Death Tracking API (WorldOMeter API)

This is an API I've developed to retrieve CoVid stats/data scraped from the
near-constantly updating WorldOMeter database.

[WorldOMeter Link](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

My intention with this API is to complete it this weekend, and host it
with GitHub Pages so other developers may include it in their projects,
assuming their projects require relatively recent data statistics on CoVid
deaths. I picked WorldOMeter specifically because I've been using it for
CoVid data since March 2020, and for several other reasons for years prior.

However, if a better source for datascraping arises, I will of course adjust.
